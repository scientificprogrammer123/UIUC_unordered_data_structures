  //next remember what a disjoint set is:
  //A pair of sets which does not have any common element are called disjoint sets. 
  //For example, set A={2,3} and set B={4,5} are disjoint sets. But set C={3,4,5} 
  //and {3,6,7} are not disjoint as both the sets C and D are having 3 as a common
  //element. Learn more about Disjoint Set here.

  //Applications
  //A demo for Union-Find when using Kruskal's algorithm to find minimum spanning tree.

  //Disjoint-set data structures model the partitioning of a set, for example to keep   
  //track of the connected components of an undirected graph. This model can then be used 
  //to determine whether two vertices belong to the same component, or whether adding an 
  //edge between them would result in a cycle. The Unionâ€“Find algorithm is used in high-
  //performance implementations of unification.[20]

  //This data structure is used by the Boost Graph Library to implement its Incremental 
  //Connected Components functionality. It is also a key component in implementing 
  //Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

  //The Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm uses a Union-Find in the algorithm.
  //See also Partition refinement, a different data structure for maintaining disjoint 
  //sets, with updates that split sets apart rather than merging them together
  //Dynamic connectivity
  
  //next, remember in a disjoint set the value of a node is -1 if it is a root node, 
  //else if the value of the node is not -1, the it is not a root node,and you must
  //traverse upwards until you find the node that is a root node.

  //Path compression:
  //Path compression` is a way of flattening the structure of the tree whenever Find is used on it. 
  //Since each element visited on the way to a root is part of the same set, all of these visited 
  //elements can be reattached directly to the root. The resulting tree is much flatter, speeding up 
  //future operations not only on these elements, but also on those referencing them.

  // 1           1 3
  //2 3         2   4
  //   4
  
  // find(3)
  // traverse up to find the set representative which is 0
  // so make subset with 3 as the child of 0 so tree will be flattened so
  // next time find(3) is called, path will be reduced.
  
  //Pseudo code:
  //function Find(x)
    //if x.parent != x
      //x.parent := Find(x.parent)
    //return x.parent

  //make use of the traversal_path.begin, and traversal_path.end() functions, and also
  //use iter function as well.
  
  //per https://cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/, 
  //std::vector is a sequence container representing arrays that can change in size.
  //in c++98 at least, it has begin and end iterators, push_back and pop_back modifiers
  
  //ok so we modify the original function given in the task
  //so if the value is less then zero, then it means it is the root node
  //and if it is the root node, then do path compression?
